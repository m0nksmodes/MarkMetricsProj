Rob Van Dam,The Whole F'N Show,Rob Van Dam v. Jerry Lynn @ Living Dangerously | March.21.1999," Talk about the pressure, no sweat.
                I didn't sweat it, you know why?
                Because I was going to have the opportunity to come out and actually use my abilities and my skills to make sure that everybody watching went home happy. 
                As long as I got the chance to do my part, that's all that mattered, you know why?
                I'm the whole fuckin' show! Mister Pay-Per-View! Mr. Monday Night! You remember what RVD 4:20 means? I just smoked your ass!
                Fonsi, how long did I defend that World Television Title?","ECW World Television Champion, longest reign in history"
Karl Gotch,The God Of Pro Wrestling,Karl Gotch & Lou Thesz v. Antonio Inoki & Seiji Sakaguchi @ NJPW | October.14.1973," To tell you the truth, the British would do very well. In America… you get top competition all the time… I love my work. I would wrestle for nothing if I had to!,
                Among the men, I have a reputation for being ‘gym crazy’… I’d rather spend hours there than go into the ring in poor shape.","NWA World Tag Team Champion, with Rene Goulet"
CM Punk,Best in the World,CM Punk v. John Cena @ Money in The Bank | July.17.2011,"  The only thing that’s real is me and the fact that day in and day out, for almost six years, I have proved to everybody in the world that I am the best on this microphone, 
                in that ring, even in commentary! Nobody can touch me! 
                And yet no matter how many times I prove it, I’m not on your lovely little collector cups.
                I’m not on the cover of the program. I’m barely promoted. I don't get to be in movies. I’m certainly not on any crappy show on the USA Network.
                I’m not on the poster of WrestleMania. I’m not on the signature that’s produced at the start of the show. I’m not on Conan O’Brian. I’m not on Jimmy Fallon.
                But the fact of the matter is, I should be.  And trust me, this isn’t sour grapes. But the fact that Dwayne is in the main event at WrestleMania next year and I’m not makes me sick!","434-day WWE Champion, defeated John Cena at MITB 2011"
MJF,Better Than You,MJF v. Bryan Danielson @ Revolution | March.5.2023,"  And now you have snuck into my company like a flea ridden rat by sticking to talents far better than you ever were, like a succubus!
                And you know who I am? I'm MJF! Oh yeah! I'm the twenty-six year-old kid who's on top of this business, I'm a generational talent!
                And I'm also the man who your former employers now, would be willing to take several human lives simply to get me to put pen to paper in the Bidding War of 2024.
                I want you to look at me nice and good when I say this Regal, I read that email every single day, but not, not to put a chip on my shoulder, no no, I read that email whenever I need a good hearty laugh.
                Because that's what you've become to me, Will: Nothing more than a joke. And you know who I'm about to become? The AEW Champion of the World! Because my name is Maxwell Jacob Friedman, and I'm better than you, and you know it!","AEW World Champion, defeated Jon Moxley at Full Gear 2022"
Bryan Danielson,American Dragon,Bryan Danielson v. Nigel McGuinness @ Unified | August.12.2006," Thank you guys very much. Now first, last week something horrific happened to Shane McMahon. And as General Manager, I will be addressing that situation, but unfortunately, the two people that I need to talk to are not here yet.
                So with that said, I am gonna talk about something else.
                A little over two years ago, when I was forced to retire, it was one of the hardest days of my life. 
                But I focused on one thing: on being grateful. And I kept on focusing on trying to be grateful… There were times when I was depressed about not being able to do what I love to do. 
                And I focused on being grateful. And I have a lot to be grateful for. … It’s wonderful that you’re grateful, but you need to fight and you need to fight for your dreams… YOU DON’T WALK OUT! 
                … FIGHT FOR YOUR DREAMS, FIGHT FOR YOUR DREAMS, FIGHT FOR YOUR DREAMS AND IF YOU FIGHT FOR YOUR DREAMS, YOUR DREAMS WILL FIGHT FOR YOU!
                Because every hard thing seems impossible until it becomes real. And over the last two months, I’ve asked WWE to relook at my case… they cleared me. … And lastly, but not leastly, I would like to say thank you… to Brie.”
                So, now onto the fun stuff, right? I don’t know exactly when or where I will get back in this ring… but will Daniel Bryan compete in a WWE ring again?!","ROH World Champion, reign during 2005-2006 era"
Mitsuhara Misawa,Mr. Triple Crown,Mitsuhara Misawa v. Kenta Kobashi @ NOAH | March.1.2003," I would like to see August at the earliest, and I would like to have the launch event in August and September.
                Regarding the staff… they are employees. It’s complicated… so please refrain from talking about it now. 
                I wanted to make the current All Japan Pro Wrestling production… more modern for young people.
                There were… fan letters asking for something like All Japan… so in that case we decided to do it ourselves.
                The promotion… is called ‘NOAH’—from Noah’s Ark… taking twenty-five athletes and six staff members on board… set off on a great voyage without being swallowed by the flood.","Triple Crown Champion, AJPW, 1992 & 1995 reigns"

                Looking at a guy out here hollering my name.
                When last year I spent more money on spilt liquor.
                In bars from one side of this world to the other, than you made.
